#  Ukrainian Carpentries Community

[*Ukrainian version*](https://ukrainian-carpentries.github.io/)
---------

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is a global community of volunteers who teach 
foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

This is the page of the Ukrainian Carpentries Community.
We are meeting every 4th Friday of the month at 16:00 Ukrainian time.
Further information about our meetings could be found [here](https://hackmd.io/drNoAPc5QpqH4nWm71YJkg?view).

See also the May 2024 report on our activities [on The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/05/software-carpentries-translation-efforts-in-ukrainian/), and the presentation ["Software Carpentry for Ukraine"](https://pure.st-andrews.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/317409931/SoftwareCarpentryForUkraine_Konovalov.pdf) at the [UK-Ukraine Networking and Research Twinning Showcase 2025](https://www.digital-ukraine.co.uk/) in March 2025.

[[Issue tracker](https://github.com/ukrainian-carpentries/shell-novice/issues/)]
[[English version](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)]

- besides that, we are working on translating [**Plotting and Programming in Python**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) and [**Introduction to R for Geospatial Data**](https://datacarpentry.github.io/r-intro-geospatial/) lessons, as well as the [Carpentries Incubator lesson on the computational algebra system **GAP**](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/gap-lesson/).


###  How it works

The Carpentries provides translation infrastructure on the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) platform. After importing the original English version of the lesson from its GitHub repository, the text is split into fragments, each of which can be independently translated, proofread, updated and approved. We keep the workflow when each translation is checked by at least one more translator before being approved. Approved fragments appear in the repository of the Ukrainian version of the lesson, where they are rendered on the lesson's website, while fragments which are not yet approved will be shown in English. This allows to easily publish work in progress, for example, when we have a few first episodes of the lesson available. In what follows, the same workflow can be used to update the translation after suggested improvements, reported errors, or changes in the English version.

## Teaching

- [Previous training events using our materials](https://ukrainian-carpentries.github.io/trainings)

- [The Carpentries Workshop Template](https://ukrainian-carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/) (including [installation instructions](https://ukrainian-carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup))
  
## Glosario

[Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/) is a multilingual glossary for computing and data science terms. Its Ukrainian section is [located here](https://glosario.carpentries.org/uk/). As in August 2025, it contains 630 English terms, of which 123 have Ukrainian translation. This makes Ukrainian the 4th most represented language in Glosario, after Amharic (288) and Spanish (146). New translations can be added to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario). See the [README.md file](https://github.com/carpentries/glosario/blob/main/README.md) for further details.
